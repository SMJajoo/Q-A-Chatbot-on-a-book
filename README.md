# Q-A-Chatbot-on-a-book
Prototype a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system using the text of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's The Hound of the Baskervilles as a test case

# Scenario
You are an AI engineer at a book publisher. The publisher is offering online versions of their books, and wants to accompany them with a chatbot that is able to answer questions using knowledge from the entire text of the book. Your manager has asked you to prototype such a system based on a public-domain novel (The Hound of the Baskervilles,) and subjectively evaluate answers to a set of test questions about the book.


# Objectives
Develop a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using langchain
Create and apply a vector store used for semantic search with langchain and FAISS
Perform chunking of textual data in the pre-retrieval stage of RAG
Use the OpenAI API through langchain to back a RAG system
Craft system prompts to guide a large language model (LLM) to generate responses in the desired style and with specified contextual information

# Requirement
Programming experience with Python in a notebook environment
Foundational knowledge of retrieval-augmented generation
Basic familiarity with OpenAI and langchain

# What you'll learn
Langchain retrieval chains
Semantic search with vector databases
Text loading and chunking with langchain
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
